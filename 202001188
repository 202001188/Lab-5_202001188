I chose the tool pylint in python for static analysis of python projects.
Used a github repository https://github.com/D3FaltXD/Python-MiniProjects-LPU2022.git

Pylint is a static code analyser . It analyses the code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard and can make suggestions.

Install pylint using the _pip install pylint_ command in command prompt.
Took sample codes from python files
Run the command _py -m pylint <file_name>.py_ in command prompt 

File 1: (Project-1.py)
The errors generated are 
  1. identation errors
  2. invalid-name (does not follow the naming conventions)
  3. redfefined-outer-name (redefine a name that is defined outside a function), missing-final-newline etc.
  4. missing-function-docstring (when a python function or method misses a docstring)
  5. missing-final-newline (when python file does not end with a newline character)

File 2: (Project-2.py)
The errors generated are
